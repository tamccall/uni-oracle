This package is an example oracle used to demonstrate how uniswap-v1 tokens might be priced and integrated into the
oracle architecture of the DAI cryptocurrency.

Please see makerdao's [oracle-v2](https://github.com/makerdao/oracles-v2) repo as well as [this forum post](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/dai-eth-uni-v1-oracle-discussion/2146/3?u=andy_mccall) for context.

This repository takes a [NAV](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nav.asp) based approach to arrive at a price for the 
uniswap tokens that is explored in the aforementioned forum thread as well as [this medium thread](https://medium.com/@pintail/understanding-uniswap-returns-cc593f3499ef).
